How can I tell if a data feed is through us?,"Ways to tell if a feed is through our services

RxLink (AKA PPOK), DataRx and RSI are examples of direct connection.
RX30, Q/S1 and Etreby all have Vendor side routing, so it is possible claims are being sent to them and then not going through us.

How does MSP 2 logic work?,"First, the following values need to be gathered and calculated. You will need to do these steps to use in later logic:
1. Billed Amount
• This is the value in the Usual & Customary field or the Gross Amount Due depending on how the pharmacy's logic is set in usmca/usflags.

2. Primary Paid
• This is the value in the Other Payer Amt Paid field

3. Primary Allowed Amount
• This is the sum of the values in the Other Payer Amt Paid and either the Other Payer-Patient Responsibility Amount (field NQ) OR the Patient paid Amount Submitted (field DX)

4. Remaining Deductible
• Either received in 271 response OR calculated based on claim history.

5. Medicare Allowed Amount
• This should be the lower of the Billed Amount or the Medicare MAC for the HCPCS code per HCPCS Info Viewer

6. Fee MAC
• This is the Medicare MAC for the dispense fee HCPCS code

7. Higher Allowed Amount
• This is the higher of Primary Allowed Amount or Medicare Allowed Amount from above calculations

8. Primary Amount Applied to Medicare Deductible
• If Remaining Deductible is zero, this amount is zero
• If Remaining Deductible is greater than or equal to the value in the Other Payer Amt Paid, use the Other Payer Amt Paid amount
• If Remaining Deductible is less than the value in Other Payer Amt Paid, use the Remaining Deductible amount","MSP II logic involves several steps to determine the payment amounts for Medicare Secondary Payer claims. First, specific values such as the Billed Amount, Primary Paid, Primary Allowed Amount, Remaining Deductible, Medicare Allowed Amount, Fee MAC, Higher Allowed Amount, and Primary Amount Applied to Medicare Deductible need to be gathered and calculated. 

Next, the Total Amount Paid is determined by adding the Medicare MSP Payment and Medicare Fee Payment. The Medicare MSP Payment is the lowest of the Billed Amount minus Other Payer Amt Paid, Medicare payment if Medicare were primary, and Higher Allowed Amount minus Primary Paid. The Medicare Fee Payment is calculated based on the Fee MAC and Remaining Deductible.

The Patient Pay amount is calculated by adding the Patient Responsibility and the Patient Fee Responsibility. Patient Responsibility is determined based on the Remaining Deductible, Medicare Allowed Amount, and Other Payer Amt Paid. Patient Fee Responsibility is calculated based on the Fee MAC and Medicare Fee Payment.

How are patient pay amounts calculated by the Enhanced Deductible tracking service?,"Enhanced Deductible Tracking Service will return a patient pay amount that reflects the outstanding deductible balance plus the standard 20% copay as long as the Group ID field is not populated with a valid COBA code (i.e. if the patient has a $5.00 remaining deductible and you bill a $100 claim, the patient would be responsible for paying the remaining deductible + 20% of the claim balance, $24.00):
 
$100.00 - $5.00=$95.00 (remaining claim balance = value of claim ($100.00) minus deductible balance ($5.00))
$95.00 x 0.20=$19.00 (patient pay amount = 20% of remaining claim balance)
$19.00 + $5.00=$24.00 (total patient pay amount = 20% copay ($19.00) plus remaining deductible ($5.00))
 
If you bill a claim with a valid Medigap Supplemental COBA code in the Group ID field, we do not assume the plan covers the patient’s deductible balance.  Due to this, the claim will return the remaining deductible balance as the patient pay amount and the 20% standard copay will be included in the Total Amount Paid as the expected payer payment.
 
If you bill a claim with a valid Medicaid COBA code in the Group ID field, we will return a $0.00 patient pay amount regardless of the remaining deductible balance as most* Medicaid plans are required to cover Medicare Part B deductibles and copays.
*NOTE:  Certain Medicaid plans include copays on crossover claims.  Please refer to their respective policy manuals for more information.","The Enhanced Deductible Tracking service calculates patient pay amounts by adding the outstanding deductible balance to the standard 20% copay. For example, if a patient has a $5.00 remaining deductible and a $100 claim is billed, the calculation would be as follows: $100.00 - $5.00 = $95.00 (remaining claim balance), $95.00 x 0.20 = $19.00 (20% of the remaining claim balance), and $19.00 + $5.00 = $24.00 (total patient pay amount).

For example, if a patient has a $5.00 remaining deductible and a $100 claim is billed, the patient would be responsible for paying the remaining deductible plus 20% of the claim balance, totaling $24.00. This is calculated as follows: $100.00 (claim amount) - $5.00 (deductible balance) = $95.00 (remaining claim balance); $95.00 x 0.20 = $19.00 (20% copay); $19.00 + $5.00 = $24.00 (total patient pay amount).
